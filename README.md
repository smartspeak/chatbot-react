# Getting Started with Fawkes React Demo

This is an example of how to embed the smartspeak chatbot into a react app.

**This example only brings in the UI.** 

The chatbot is not hooked up to a working orchestrator, and as such, is missing chat functionality.

## Installation
Run `npm i` in the project directory

## Starting the app
Run `npm run start` in the project directory
